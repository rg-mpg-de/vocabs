# Matters of Police Ordinances

The file `polmat.ttl`contains a systematic taxonomy of more than 1.800 matters regulated by police ordinances (last revised: Oct 2021). It is a SKOS vocabulary encoded in ttl/"turtle" format.

The taxonomy has originated in the project "[Repertory of Policeyordnungen](https://www.lhlt.mpg.de/research-project/repertory-of-policeyordnungen)" of the (then) [Max Planck Institute for Legal History and Legal Theory](https://www.lhlt.mpg.de/en). Initially this system of categories has been established in German in 1996 by Karl HÃ¤rter and Michael Stolleis.

The taxonomy has been SKOS-ified in November 2020 by Annemieke Romein and Andreas Wagner.

The taxonomy and other aspects of modeling police ordinances data are currently maintained and further developed by a "police ordinances community" (see this [wiki and repository](https://github.com/rhonda-org/PoliceOrdinances/wiki)).
The taxonomy is published under CC0, but we will be happy if you give attribution when you use it.
